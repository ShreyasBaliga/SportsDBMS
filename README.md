# SportsDBMS

Sports Database Management is used to store the data of people playing various sports. Various clubs belonging to a particular country can register by providing necessary details. Once they login they'll be able to insert,delete or update players and their stats belonging to them. The users no need to login, they can view the player details by selecting the country and the club they want.

For now we've added only **Cricket**:cricket:	and **Football**:soccer:. So if you want to add any sports of your choice feel free to do so as it won't affect the working of any other pages, but make sure you have changed the database:wink: so you won't run into any trouble later.
